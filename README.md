An Oracle program designed to verify if the rules of Quantum Go Fish are being respected in actual play. 

Rules (modified from https://gamerules.com/rules/quantum-go-fish/)

There are as many suits as there are players. Each suit has four cards. These suits do not have to be traditional suits, and they may be made up by the players as they go. The first player to ask for a card of the suit, gets to create the suit.

Each player may only ask one question during their turn, and the player on the left goes next. Players may only ask for suits that they themselves have one of. This means that when a player asks for a card, they are announcing that they have at least one of that suit in their hand. They determine their own hand by what they ask other players for. No player knows their hand, or any other player’s hand, when the game first begins.

When you are asked for a card, you determine if you have that suit in your hand or not. If you do, you must give that “card” to the other player, making it so that you are holding one less card.

The game is lost if at any point a paradox is created - such as where more or less than 4 cards of any suit must exist based on the questions and answers so far, or one player defines their hand as containing a suit / gains a card of that suit, and subsequently answers no when asked if they have any of said suit without having transferred it away.

In such a situation, all players lose and there are no winners. 

Otherwise, the game is won when a player can prove they have four cards of the same suit in hand, or can prove what every players hand must contain.
